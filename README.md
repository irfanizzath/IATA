About the program
This is an user interactive data guide powered by Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

The IATA Data Guide analyzes a database containing all the airports in the world under the IATA, using Python Pandas and Matplotlib. The database includes the IATA codes of all airports, their location, type of airport, etc. The database is aimed towards flight enthusiasts or those working in the airline industry who want to acquire more information about these airports.

The IATA Data Guide includes several features, these include:

• About IATA: A background for the organization responsible for this data, The International Air Transport Association. The IATA is a trade association of all the world’s airlines, and they are responsible for setting technical standards and fixing tariffs for airlines around the world.

• IATA Airport Finder: The star of the program, the IATA Airport Finder uses a database of all the world’s airports, allowing the user to search for any airport in the world by entering its IATA Code and acquiring information about that airport. Users can also add or remove airports from the database in case of future expansion or demolition of airports.

• Passenger Statistics: This feature of the program allows the user to view the yearly passenger statistics of the world’s Top Ten Airports in the form of a bar graph, providing the user with the information required to analyze the airport’s growth over the last 10 years.

• Airport Statistics: Accessing this feature provides the user with a pie chart about the different types of airports in the world, as well as a line graph of the monthly worldwide passenger statistics for the year 2019.

• Flight Radar and Ground Conditions: This feature of the program allows the user to enter any airport code and redirects you to www.flightradar24.com, automatically inputting the location for the user. The user can now view the path of all current flights flying to and from the airport at that moment, and also allows them to view the current ground conditions at the airport.

We believe that this program is valuable to those in the airline industry or flight enthusiasts, allowing them to access data they would not have been able to access as easily.
